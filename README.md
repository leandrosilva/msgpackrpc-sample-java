# msgpackrpc-sample-java

This is a sample of a MessagePack-RPC client/server application built in Java. Really simple, but enough to try that stuff.

### MessagePack

* [The MessagePack Project](http://msgpack.org)
* [MessagePack Wiki](http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/Home)
* [QuickStart for Java](http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/QuickStart+for+Java)

## Usage

    $ git clone https://github.com/leandrosilva/msgpackrpc-sample-java

After, you can just import the project to Eclipse and try it there. Or you might want to use Maven directly from command line with two terminal instances, this is up to you, my friend.

## What else?

I have also a sample of a Java client talking to the Clojure server:

A sample of client and server in Clojure:

* [https://github.com/leandrosilva/msgpackrpc-sample-clojure](https://github.com/leandrosilva/msgpackrpc-sample-clojure)

And, of course, you can mix them the way you want:

* Java serve with Clojure client
* Clojure server with Java client
